Prompt templates for Anthropic Claude models.

Claude Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses XML-like tags (<context>, <instructions>, <thinking>) to delineate prompt sections.
      Claude is specifically trained to recognize and respect these structural markers, leading to
      more precise instruction following and reduced hallucination.
    - Embeds a <thinking> block to guide Claude's internal reasoning focus before it generates output.
      This steers attention toward architectural concerns without requiring verbose explanations.
    - Prompts are moderately concise: Claude infers intent well from structured context, so lengthy
      elaboration is unnecessary and can actually degrade output quality.
    - Tool usage instructions use imperative "you MUST use" phrasing within <instructions> tags,
      which Claude reliably respects without needing repetition or capitalized directives.

Your Task:
GROUP similar clusters together into logical components based on their relationships and purpose.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the clusters shown above and identify which ones work together or are functionally related
2. Group related clusters into meaningful components
3. A component can contain one or more cluster IDs (e.g., [1], [2, 5], or [3, 7, 9])
4. For each grouped component, provide:
   - **name**: Short, descriptive name for this group (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Data Pipeline', 'Request Handling')
   - **cluster_ids**: List of cluster IDs that belong together (as a list, e.g., [1, 3, 5])
   - **description**: Comprehensive explanation including:
     * What this component does
     * What is its main flow/purpose
