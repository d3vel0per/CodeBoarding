"""
Prompt templates for Zhipu GLM models.

GLM Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses heavy directive language ("STRICTLY follow these rules", "MANDATORY", "MUST", "REQUIRED")
      throughout every prompt. GLM models tend to drift from instructions or take creative liberties
      unless constraints are stated emphatically and repeatedly.
    - Each prompt assigns a specific role identity ("You are a software architecture expert",
      "You are a file reference resolver") to anchor the model's behavior. GLM produces more
      consistent output when given a strong persona framing at the start of each prompt.
    - Steps are explicitly labeled with ordering ("REQUIRED STEPS (execute in order)") and output
      sections are marked with "(complete all)" or "(complete ALL)". Without these markers, GLM
      may produce partial outputs or skip required sections.
    - Constraints are stated both positively and negatively ("MUST analyze", "STRICTLY avoid") because
      GLM responds better to explicit boundary-setting than to implied expectations.
