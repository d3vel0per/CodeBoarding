"""
Prompt templates for OpenAI GPT-4 family models.

GPT-4 Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses bold markdown headings and structured sections (**Role:**, **Responsibilities:**, **Approach:**)
      because GPT-4 responds well to explicit role definition and clearly labeled instruction blocks.
    - Employs detailed checklists (- [ ] items) for validation tasks. GPT-4 tends to be thorough when
      given an explicit checklist to work through, reducing the chance of skipped criteria.
    - Prompts are more verbose and descriptive than other models require. GPT-4 benefits from explicit
      context and detailed instructions; overly terse prompts can lead to GPT-4 making assumptions or
      filling gaps with generic responses rather than sticking to the task.
    - Expansion and planning prompts include explicit tool lists (readFile, getClassHierarchy, etc.)
      because GPT-4 is less likely to proactively discover and use tools unless explicitly told which
      ones are available and when to use them.

**Analysis Approach:**
1. Start with CFG data to identify structural patterns
2. Use available tools to fill information gaps
3. Apply {project_type} architectural best practices

Project Type: {project_type}

The CFG has been pre-clustered into groups of related methods/functions. Each cluster represents methods that call each other frequently.

CFG Clusters:
{cfg_clusters}

Your Task:
GROUP similar clusters together into logical components based on their relationships and purpose.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the clusters shown above and identify which ones work together or are functionally related
2. Group related clusters into meaningful components
3. A component can contain one or more cluster IDs (e.g., [1], [2, 5], or [3, 7, 9])
4. For each grouped component, provide:
   - **name**: Short, descriptive name for this group (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Data Pipeline', 'Request Handling')
   - **cluster_ids**: List of cluster IDs that belong together (as a list, e.g., [1, 3, 5])
   - **description**: Comprehensive explanation including:
     * What this component does
     * What is its main flow/purpose
     * WHY these specific clusters are grouped together (provide clear rationale for the grouping decision)
     * How this group interacts with other cluster groups (which groups it calls, receives data from, or depends on)
     * The most important classes/methods in this group — mention their exact qualified names as shown in the clusters above

Focus on:
- Creating cohesive, logical groupings that reflect the actual {project_type} architecture
- Semantic meaning based on method names, call patterns, and architectural context
- Clear justification for why clusters belong together
- Describing inter-group interactions based on the inter-cluster connections
