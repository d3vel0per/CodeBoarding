"""
Prompt templates for Moonshot Kimi models.

Kimi Prompt Design Principles:
    - Every prompt begins with "You are Kimi, an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI." This identity
      anchor is required because Kimi performs significantly better when its own identity is reinforced
      at the start of each message, not just in the system prompt.
    - Emphasizes explicit chain-of-thought cues ("Reason step-by-step", "Think aloud first",
      "Decompose tasks into parallel subtasks"). Kimi benefits from being told to reason before
      acting; without these cues it tends to jump to conclusions or produce shallow analysis.
    - Includes "Use tools proactively to verify facts" directives because Kimi's default behavior
      is conservative with tool usage; it needs encouragement to call tools rather than guess.
    - Prompt structure is conversational but directive, matching Kimi's training style. Overly formal
      or rigid formatting (like strict markdown headers) is less effective than natural task framing.

SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """You are Kimi, an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI.

Project Context:
{meta_context}

Analyze Control Flow Graphs (CFG) for `{project_name}` and generate a high-level data flow overview optimized for diagram generation.

Reason step-by-step. Decompose tasks into parallel subtasks if possible. Use tools to verify facts when information is missing.

Your analysis must include:
- Central modules/functions (maximum 20) from CFG data with clear interaction patterns
- Logical component groupings with clear responsibilities suitable for flow graph representation
- Component relationships and interactions that translate to clear data flow arrows
- Reference to relevant source files for interactive diagram elements

Focus on architectural patterns for {project_type} projects with clear component boundaries suitable for diagram generation."""

CLUSTER_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """You are Kimi, an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI.

Project Context:
Project Type: {project_type}

{meta_context}

Analyze and GROUP the Control Flow Graph clusters for `{project_name}`.

The CFG has been pre-clustered into groups of related methods/functions. Each cluster represents methods that call each other frequently.

CFG Clusters:
{cfg_clusters}

Task: GROUP similar clusters together into logical components based on their relationships and purpose.

Reason carefully, then execute:

1. Analyze the clusters shown above and identify which ones work together or are functionally related.
2. Group related clusters into meaningful components.
3. A component can contain one or more cluster IDs (e.g., [1], [2, 5], or [3, 7, 9]).
4. For each grouped component, provide:
   - **name**: Short, descriptive name for this group (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Data Pipeline', 'Request Handling')
   - **cluster_ids**: List of cluster IDs that belong together (as a list, e.g., [1, 3, 5])
   - **description**: Comprehensive explanation including:
     * What this component does
     * What is its main flow/purpose
     * WHY these specific clusters are grouped together (provide clear rationale for the grouping decision)
     * How this group interacts with other cluster groups (which groups it calls, receives data from, or depends on)
     * The most important classes/methods in this group — mention their exact qualified names as shown in the clusters above

Focus on creating cohesive, logical groupings that reflect the actual {project_type} architecture based on semantic meaning from method names, call patterns, and architectural context. Describe inter-group interactions based on the inter-cluster connections.

Output Format:
Return a ClusterAnalysis with cluster_components using ClustersComponent model.
Each component should have name (descriptive label), cluster_ids (list), and description (comprehensive explanation with rationale and inter-group interactions)."""
