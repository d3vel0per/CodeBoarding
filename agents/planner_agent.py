"""
Deterministic component expansion planning.

This module provides fast, deterministic logic to decide which components
should be expanded into sub-components. Unlike the previous LLM-based approach,
this uses CFG clustering structure as the source of truth.

Expansion Rules:
1. If component has source_cluster_ids -> expandable (CFG structure exists)
2. If component has no clusters but has files -> expandable ONE level (to explain files)
3. If neither component nor its parent has clusters -> leaf (stop expanding)

Note: The MIN_CLUSTERS_THRESHOLD in constants.py controls when subgraphs are
automatically expanded to method-level clustering in cluster_methods_mixin.py.
This ensures fine-grained method assignment even for small components.

Example:
- Component: "Agents" (clusters: [1,2,3]) -> expand (yes)
  - Sub-component: "DetailsAgent" (clusters: [], files: [details_agent.py]) -> expand (yes, parent had clusters)
    - Sub-sub-component: "run_method" (clusters: [], files: []) -> DON'T expand (no, parent had no clusters)

    Determine if a component should be expanded into sub-components.

    Expansion logic:
    - If component has clusters -> expand (there's CFG structure to decompose)
    - If component has no clusters but has files -> expand if parent had clusters
      (allows one more level to explain file internals)
    - If neither component nor parent has clusters -> stop (leaf node)

    Note: Method-level cluster expansion is handled separately in
    cluster_methods_mixin._expand_to_method_level_clusters() when a subgraph
    has fewer than MIN_CLUSTERS_THRESHOLD clusters. This ensures the planner
    doesn't need to worry about method counts.
